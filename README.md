# Very simplistic drawing in the browser

Part of [The Odin's project foundation course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

## Implemented requirements
- [x] create pixels programmatically
- [x] paint with one or (optional) random color
- [x] resize canvas
- [x] fixed canvas size (50% viewport)
- [x] clear canvas
- [ ] (optional) gradual darkening in random color mode

## Things learned
- [x] creating a regular grid programmatically
- [x] querying radio group for checked value
- [x] handling colors in vanilla JS is messy.
